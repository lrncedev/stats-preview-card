## My process
Just like the Product preview card, i made this using div and inside the div, are 2 sub divs. Which are my flex-items.

The first flex item is for the image, while the latter is for the texts.
As for the desktop view, i used row-revers instead of 'order'. 
Set the flex-items to both 100% width, although there are still discrepancies on sizing because of margins and paddings that i used.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used row-reverse instead of order now. I usually think of using orders instead of row-reverse. Also utilized creating mobile-first approac.


### Continued development

Will be fixing the tint color of the image, as well as the size. Probably gonna fixed the mobile view sizing too.
